Additionally, I serve as a graduate student researcher at the MIT Election Data and Science Lab.\nMy research interests broadly include policymaking, group influence, and public opinion as it relates to the politics of election administration in the United States. More specifically, my current work is focused on (1) how rules and choices in election administration impact voter confidence and turnout, (2) the state-level legislative and voter coalitions that call for and create changes to election procedures, and (3) the role organizations play via both legislatures and courts in shaping the voting experience.\nBefore coming to MIT, I worked as a client support analyst at Civis Analytics, an aide for a member of the New York State Assembly, an intern for the U.S. Senate, and a staffer for local-level political campaigns — my work draws heavily on these experiences. I graduated Phi Beta Kappa with a B.A. in Political Science and Statistics from the University of Rochester where I earned the James D. McGill Memorial Prize in Political Science."

We examine how incumbents use this control to protect their interests by leveraging the California Voting Rights Act of 2001, which prompted hundreds of jurisdictions to switch from at-large to district elections to improve minority representation. Using a state-of-the-art redistricting simulation algorithm, we show that adopted council maps overwhelmingly placed incumbents alone in their districts-63% of cities’ plans ranked in the 99th percentile or higher for avoidance of incumbent pairings. This pattern was especially pronounced in smaller, whiter cities with lower turnout and more competitive elections. Crucially, incumbent protection deters challenger entry and reduces Latino electoral success. In Latino-opportunity districts, a lone incumbent decreases the probability of a Latino being elected by 19 percentage points. Our findings show how reforms can be blunted by those empowered to implement them, ultimately reinforcing existing power structures.\n\nLoffredo, Joseph R., Jillian Andres Rothschild, and Alejandro Flores. 2025. “America Decides, Networks Project: How Voters Respond to Election Night Coverage.” Paper preprint is available here.\n\n\nAbstract\n\nWhile election officials count votes and certify winners, media outlets play a critical yet unofficial role in presenting and contextualizing results. Public trust in elections, however, depends on whether outcomes are seen as clear, legitimate, and widely accepted. In a fragmented media environment, partisans increasingly rely on ideologically aligned outlets, raising the question: how can there be clarity and acceptance when the source and timing of projections differ? In this study, we utilize a series of survey vignette experiments fielded before and after the 2024 U.S. election to test this question. Our findings reveal that voter confidence is indeed shaped by projection source and timing, with conflicting projections eroding trust. We complement these experiments with a survey fielded on Election Night to examine the real-time dynamics of voter confidence and emotional affect. We find suggestive evidence that confidence fluctuates throughout Election Night among politically disengaged voters, while supporters of the losing candidate experience rising pessimism as the outcome becomes apparent. These results show that even when citizens receive the same substantive information, the context, perspective, and framing in which it is delivered shapes how it is processed. Thus, our work highlights that variation in the editorial choices of media outlets can deepen divides in how partisans evaluate the performance of elections. This underscores the need for both media and election officials to consider how election coverage influences voter confidence and to take steps that strengthen perceptions of democratic legitimacy."
