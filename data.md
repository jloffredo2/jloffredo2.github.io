# Data
## STATE ELECTIONS LEGISLATION DATABASE
**Available on [GitHub](https://github.com/jloffredo2/state-elect-law-db)**

This dataset, which is automatically updated each week, is the product of scraping the National Conference of State Legislature's [State Elections Legislation Database](http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/elections-legislation-database.aspx) and Voting Rights Lab's [Legislative Tracker](https://tracker.votingrightslab.org/pending/search). Use the available `.csv` or `.Rdata` files to access an up-to-date table of election legislation in the United States.
