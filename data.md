# Data
## NCSL STATE ELECTIONS LEGISLATION DATABASE
**Available on (GitHub)[https://github.com/jloffredo2/state-elect-law-db]**

This dataset, which is automatically updated each week, is the product of scraping the National Conference of State Legislature's [State Elections Legislation Database](http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/elections-legislation-database.aspx). Use the available `.csv` or `.Rdata` files to access an up-to-date table of election legislation in the United States.

# Code
As my work continues, you will find important repositories here. For now, please see my [GitHub page](https://github.com/jloffredo2) for some of my latest code.
