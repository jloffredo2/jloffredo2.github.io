<p>Welcome! I am a PhD Candidate in the Department of Political Science at MIT focused in American Politics and Quantitative Methods. Additionally, I serve as a graduate student researcher at the <a href="https://electionlab.mit.edu">MIT Election Data and Science Lab</a>.</p>

<p>My research interests broadly include policymaking, group influence, and public opinion as it relates to the politics of election administration in the United States. More specifically, my current work is focused on (1) how rules and choices in election administration impact voter confidence and turnout, (2) the state-level legislative and voter coalitions that call for and create changes to election procedures, and (3) the role organizations play via both legislatures and courts in shaping the voting experience.</p>

<p>Before coming to MIT, I worked as a client support analyst at Civis Analytics, an aide for a member of the New York State Assembly, an intern for the U.S. Senate, and a staffer for local-level political campaigns --- my work draws heavily on these experiences. I graduated Phi Beta Kappa with a B.A. in Political Science and Statistics from the University of Rochester where I earned the James D. McGill Memorial Prize in Political Science.</p>
