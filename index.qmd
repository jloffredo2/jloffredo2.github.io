Welcome! I am a PhD Candidate in the Department of Political Science at MIT. Additionally, I serve as a graduate student researcher at the [MIT Election Data and Science Lab](https://electionlab.mit.edu).

I am a scholar of legislative politics and public policy, with a focus on organized group influence in American political institutions. My current research centers on election policy and election administration in the United States. I examine how coalitions of legislators and interest groups shape the adoption of election reforms, how institutional incentives structure their implementation, and how those reforms affect representation and voter confidence.

Before coming to MIT, I worked as a client support analyst at Civis Analytics, an aide for a member of the New York State Assembly, an intern for the U.S. Senate, and a staffer for local-level political campaigns — my work draws heavily on these experiences. I graduated Phi Beta Kappa with a B.A. in Political Science and Statistics from the University of Rochester where I earned the James D. McGill Memorial Prize in Political Science.
