# Educational Materials
## American Politics General Exam Materials
In 2023, I took the MIT American Politics general exam. In preparation for that exam, Alejandro Frydman, Gabrielle PÃ©loquin-Skulski, and I compiled notes on relevant readings for both the study of political behavior and political institutions. These notes built on the great work of Chloe Wittenberg and other students from the department who took exams in the years before us. These notes were last updated in the summer of 2024. As a disclaimer, these materials should not substitute your own reading of the material, but do provide a good basis for preparing to take a general exam in American politics.

## Introduction to LaTeX
To help new graduate students use LaTeX for writing papers and creating slide decks, I produced these materials as part of a workshop series sponsored by MIT's Political Methodology Lab. In the folder found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19KoMPfFLGQOu5yaFFc5UlnXYgUXUjeE-?usp=drive_link) are the workshop slide deck providing an overview of LaTeX and sample papers, beamer presentations, and bibliography file.
